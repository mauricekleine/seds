The school follows the Andhra Pradesh State Board prescribed syllabus and uses English for the medium of instruction. In keeping with our environmental focus, hill-top field visits, ecology lessons, stage plays and songs with a conservation theme all an important part of the coursework."

      The school has more than 50 children at present with a capacity to expand
      up to 160 students. With a class size of 20, the school has so far
      supported more than 600 sponsored students. Attached to the school, the
      SEDS hostel provides a safe and clean environment for children whose
      domestic environment may not be conducive to learning. The hostel facility
      has helped improve attendance rates and ensure the continuing education of
      several students who would otherwise have not been able to finish their
      schooling due to family circumstances.

      The SEDS school is looking for volunteers with teaching experience who are
      interested in transforming the lives of rural children through education.
      A minimum of 6 monthâ€™s commitment is required for a teaching internship at
      SEDS. We also hope to establish an endowment fund that will provide for
      the needs of the school in the years to come. Please e-mail us from the
      contact page to find out how you can help.
